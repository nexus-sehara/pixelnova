# Project Development Phases

Welcome to the project phase directory!  
This folder contains step-by-step checklists for every major phase of the project. Each checklist ensures that all critical tasks are completed, tested, and reviewed before moving to the next phase.

## How to Use

- Each phase's checklist is named: `phase-{n}-{name}.md` (e.g., `phase-1-core-infrastructure.md`)
- Mark each step as `- [x]` when completed and tested.
- Use these checklists as the single source of truth for project progress and accountability.
- Before moving to the next phase, ensure all acceptance criteria are met and the phase is signed off by the project lead or architect.

## Best Practices

- **Documentation**: Keep each checklist up to date with any new requirements or lessons learned.
- **Accountability**: Assign an owner for each phase to ensure clear responsibility.
