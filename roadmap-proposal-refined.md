# Nova Pixel: Recommendation Engine – Refined Roadmap & Architecture

---

## 1. Executive Overview

Nova Pixel is a modern, privacy-aware Shopify application for cross-session, real-time, and personalized product recommendations. By leveraging Shopify Web Pixels, Redis, PostgreSQL, and advanced analytics, it empowers merchants with actionable insights and best-in-class onsite personalization.

---

## 2. Architectural Improvements & Enhancements

### 2.1. Technical Enhancements

- **Modular Microservices**: Separate event ingest, recommendation engine, analytics, and dashboard services for scalability and easier maintenance.
- **Event Streaming**: Use Kafka or managed PubSub for real-time, resilient event flow, handling spikes and replay on failure.
- **Feature Store (optional future)**: Centralized store for user/product features, enabling rapid evolution of ML models and experimentation.
- **Incremental ML Pipeline**: Pluggable ML logic for product ranking and retraining, supporting both rules-based and learn-to-rank methods.

### 2.2. Data & Privacy Enhancements

- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: Audit trails, data de-personalization, and merchant-configurable data retention.
- **Extensible Data Schema**: Flexible event and session models supporting custom events, browser/device/geo fields.

### 2.3. Usability Improvements

- **No-Code Widget Builder**: Admin UI for designing and A/B testing storefront widgets.
- **Self-Serve Analytics**: Real-time, segmentable dashboards (sales, CTR, engagement, opt-in/opt-out).
- **Fine-Grained API Access**: RESTful and GraphQL endpoints for integration with custom storefronts or analytics stacks.

## 3. Project Phases, Milestones & Deliverables

### **PHASE 0: Requirements, Architecture, and Planning** *(1-2 weeks)*

- Finalize technical design and component diagrams
- Create data schemas; define extensibility touchpoints
- Define privacy states: guest, pending, authenticated, opted-out
- Deliverable: Architectural Spec Document, Technical Risk Register

---

### **PHASE 1: Core Infrastructure and Data Pipeline (MVP Foundation)** *(2-3 weeks)*

- Set up repository, CI/CD, secrets management
- Implement **event ingestion API** (secure, performant, async)
- Establish Redis, PostgreSQL, and (optionally) Kafka setup
- Design and test core event/session models
- Deliverable: Working data pipeline with test coverage

---

### **PHASE 2: Session & User Models, Recommendation Logic** *(2-3 weeks)*

- Implement session/user handling (privacy-first, expiry, opt-in)
- Build rule-based recommendation engine (tags, collections, price bands, device, recency, popularity)
- Add A/B logic toggles (by shop, segment)
- Deliverable: RESTful recommendations API with session/user support; fallback & privacy rules

---

### **PHASE 3: Merchant Dashboard and Storefront Embeddables** *(2-4 weeks)*

- Dashboard: Install/configure app, view metrics, opt-in/out, exclusions builder
- Widget system: No-code UI; embeddable pixel+UI snippet
- Real-time visualization: Views, clicks, conversion for last X days, A/B split data
- Deliverable: Embedded Shopify app UI, widget builder, dashboard analytics

---

### **PHASE 4: Advanced Recommendations and Analytics** *(3-5 weeks)*

- Integrate collaborative filtering, affinity, and basic ML models
- Product catalog webhooks and periodic sync
- Implement order and checkout events for richer scoring
- Admin A/B testing configuration; result reporting
- Deliverable: ML-driven recommendations, plug-in model for custom logic

---

### **PHASE 5: Compliance, Scale, and Observability** *(2+ weeks, ongoing)*

- GDPR/CCPA tools, data erasure, retention, audit logging
- Load tests, autoscaling, service monitoring/dashboards
- Stress and failover testing; alerting on performance regressions
- Deliverable: DSR/DAR tools, load/performance report, operational dashboards

---

## 4. Additional Professional Recommendations

- **Documentation-First Development**: Ship thorough API, event, and privacy docs from day one.
- **Test Automation**: E2E tests for ingestion, suggestions, and analytics UI; red team privacy tests.
- **Plugin Extensions**: Design API/webhooks for external plugins (e.g., 3rd-party recommendation or analytics).
- **Continuous Merchant Feedback**: Ship iterative betas, measure merchant NPS and usability continuously.

---

## 5. Summary Timeline

- **MVP Goal**: Core ingestion, rules-based engine, dashboards, privacy compliance (6-8 weeks)
- **Extended**: ML, A/B, advanced analytics, feature store, scale/hardening (8-12+ weeks)
